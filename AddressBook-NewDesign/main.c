  Address Book Project
  --------------------
  A simple and interactive C program to manage your personal or professional contacts.
 
  Project Overview:
    - This application allows users to store, search, edit, and delete contact information.
    - Each contact consists of a name, phone number, and email address.
    - All contacts are stored in memory and can be saved to a file for future use.
 
  Main Features:
    1. Create Contact: Add a new contact with validation for unique phone and email.
    2. Search Contact: Find contacts by name, phone, or email with flexible matching.
    3. Edit Contact: Update the name, phone, or email of an existing contact.
    4. Delete Contact: Remove a contact from the address book.
    5. List All Contacts: Display all saved contacts in a formatted table.
    6. Save Contacts: Write all contacts to a file for persistence.
    7. Exit: Quit the program safely.
 
  Usage Instructions:
    - Run the program and follow the on-screen menu.
    - Input is validated to prevent duplicate phone numbers and emails.
    - Data is saved to a file so you can retrieve your contacts later.
 
  File Structure:
    - main.c: Contains the main menu and program loop.
    - contact.c/h: Core logic for contact management (create, edit, delete, validate).
    - searchsort.c: Functions for searching and sorting contacts.
    - file.c/h: Handles saving and loading contacts from a file.
 
  Extensibility:
    - The code is modular and can be extended to support more fields (e.g., address, birthday).
    - Additional features like import/export, group contacts, or UI enhancements can be added.
 
  Suitable For:
    - Students learning C programming and file handling.
    - Anyone needing a basic, menu-driven contact manager.
